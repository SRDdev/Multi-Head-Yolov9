## Training a Modified YOLOv9-c Model for Clothes Detection and Instance Segmentation

### Introduction
This document outlines the approach and steps taken to train a modified YOLOv9-c model for clothes detection and instance segmentation using the DeepFashion dataset. The modified model architecture includes an additional head for instance segmentation, enabling simultaneous prediction of bounding boxes, instance segmentation masks, category, and confidence scores.

### 1. Environment Setup
- Utilized Google Colab GPU for accelerated training.
- Installed necessary libraries and dependencies, including PyTorch, torchvision, and other required packages.

### 2. Data Preparation
- Downloaded the DeepFashion dataset from the provided link.
- Created a small sample of the dataset containing 578 images.
- Included classes with more than 50 images, namely "Long Sleeve Top," "Short Sleeve Top," and "Shorts."
- Divided the dataset into train, validation, and test splits in a 7:2:1 ratio.

### 3. Model Architecture
- Modified the YOLOv9-c model architecture to include an additional head for instance segmentation.
- Initialized the model with pretrained weights from 'yolov9-c.pt,' which were pretrained on the MS COCO dataset.

### 4. Training Script Modification
- Adapted the training script to accommodate the additional instance segmentation head.
- Implemented functionality to read hyperparameters and configurations from a single YAML file for flexibility.

### 5. Training Procedure
- Initialized training with hyperparameters specified in the config YAML file.
- Utilized SGD optimization, cosine learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation techniques for efficient training.
- Monitored training progress by logging key metrics such as loss and mAP.

### 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the trained model on validation and test datasets to assess performance in detection and instance segmentation.
- Calculated performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score using standard evaluation methodologies.

### Conclusion
By following this approach, a modified YOLOv9-c model was successfully trained for clothes detection and instance segmentation on the DeepFashion dataset. The use of pretrained weights, GPU acceleration, and comprehensive training procedures facilitated the development of a robust and effective model. Further analysis and optimization can be performed to enhance performance and applicability in real-world scenarios.
